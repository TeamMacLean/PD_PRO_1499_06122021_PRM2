```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load and run checks previously decided upon for these sorts of data


```{r}

library(pepdiff)


d <- import_data(here::here("cleaned", "cleaned_data.csv"), 
                 gene_id = "molecule_list_name", 
                 treatment = "genotype", 
                 peptide = "peptide_modified_sequence", 
                 seconds = "timepoint")
```

## Check number of missing data points

Includes at tech rep level

Missing data

```{r}
missing_peptides_plot(d)
```

Replicate level
```{r}
times_measured(d)
times_measured_plot(d)
```


## Look at similarity of samples


```{r}
plot_pca(d)
plot_kmeans(d)
```

## Look at distribution of quantifications

```{r}
plot_quant_distributions(d)
plot_quant_distributions(d, log = TRUE)
norm_qqplot(d)
norm_qqplot(d, log = TRUE)
```
